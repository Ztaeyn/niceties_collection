#Use this for the Actions fields of an automation.
#This action will trigger a random color from the listed colors. Perfect for Hue and Ikea.
#NOTE: These names are based on Hue lamps, some colors won't work on Ikea Tradfri, and probably go white for that instance. I use this for 5 different lights on a room for some fancy mix of colors.
#I'm planning on creating a list separately for those two systems.
